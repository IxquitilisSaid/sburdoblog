####**Hello World (bio)**

Since it's an autobiographical post, guess I should start from the beginning...<br/>
Well, my name is Jaime Oliveira but online I'm also known as Gondola or Ixquitilis. As of writing this post I'm 21 years old and I've been a professional
developer for 5 years.<br/>
I consider myself a Fullstack Developer even if my current title is Frontend Developer and UX/UI Designer, but let's not hang too much on that.<br/>
What else can I share about myself... I'm Jewish, Luso-Brazilian, born and raised in Portugal, lived in England for a year, 5 years in Brazil and
I'm currently working/living in Germany.<br/>
Also I dropped out of college... Twice (Mechatronics Engineering and Computer Science) but I have a minor in Science and Technology.<br/>
That being said, let's get to how I started programming.

####**printf("Hello, World!")**

So I actually started coding pretty early. I remember it vividly, my godfather Jaime (we share the same name as my granddad) pulled me
to the side during my 10th birthday and gave me this old, beat-up and dusty tome of a book called **"The C Programming Language"**.<br/>
He knew I fucking loved video games and computers so he went on and on about the wonders of programming, how I could make my own games and
basically "own" the computer.<br/>
I thought "Fuck... That sound like some dope shit, homie!" so the very next day I woke up extra early and booted my crappy HP Pavillion laptop, installed CodeBlocks
and went to town on that tome of a book.<br/>
C was a **BITCH**! I didn't quite understand most of its features, StackOverflow wasn't around at the time and I was too much of a scaredy cat to ask anything
in the IRC channels, nevertheless I made some silly projects like a Tetris and Snake clone, FizzBuzz, Text-based CLI RPG adventures, the usual kid shit.<br/>
But, alas, WoW and Team Fortress 2 came around and I stopped coding to focus on becoming a MLG Gamer.

####**console.log("Hello, World!")**

Yeah, Javascript... Love it or hate it, the Language of the Web!<br/>
Can't recall what made me get into it outside from playing Neopets with another young guild member and owning a MySpace account.
Most of my JS code was copy-pasted from forums, so I had the habit of "reverse-engineering" it.
Basically removing, changing parts of it and trying my best to understand what the fuck happened.<br/>
As for HTML and CSS, I would copy the layouts of popular sites and edit it by cycling through the properties in the documentation until I positioned
that fucking button where I wanted it to be.<br/>
This gave me a shallow knowledge on how the basic Web stack worked but it wouldn't be until the middle of 2015 where I actually started taking it seriously.

####**A light at the end of the tunnel**

Feel free to skip this section if it's **too personal** but from 2014 to 2016 I was a wreck.<br/>
I met the most wonderful, caring and beautiful person ever. She helped me during my parents divorce, losing everything (again) and the manifestations of my
Persistent Depressive Disorder.<br/>
At the time I was studying in a cram school, trying my hardest to become a Diplomat. Mainly because I didn't want to be a doctor or a lawyer like most of my
family members were. Jewish family, remember?<br/>
After she broke up with me because I started to affect her mental state, shit hit the fucking fan.
2 years blinked out of existence and somehow I found myself studying S&T.<br/>
I **HATED** the course, I **HATED** myself and I **HATED** the fact that I didn't have any
talent or passions other than playing video games. Until a friend of mine recommended an online school called Alura.<br/>
Alura is pretty much a freeCodeCamp but... Not free. He hammered the idea into my head for a week until I gave in, begged my mum for a subscription and started taking classes.<br/>
HOLY SHIT THAT WAS LIKE CRACK! The first 2 weeks I was doing an hour of lessons everyday but eventually I stopped going to college, waking up at 5am and going to sleep at 2am, plowing through the courses.<br/>
I finally found something that gave me joy, that made me feel productive and less of a sack of useless shit!<br/>
Since that day, my life changed for the better. Yeah, I dropped out of college twice but only because I started working to support myself after being kicked out, but that's a story for another day.

####**Conclusion**

I **FUCKING LOVE** programming!<br/>
That's it.<br/>
See ya in the next post!
