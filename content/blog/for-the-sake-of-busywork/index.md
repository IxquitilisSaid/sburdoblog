title: For the sake of busywork

In Brazil we have a saying: Looking for hairs on eggs.<br/>
I think it fits pretty well the subject of this post, "Busywork".

####**What is "Busywork"?**

I won't bore you with the Webster definition of it but in the context of this post, it means "finding an itch to scratch".<br/>
And that's exactly the mentality of most Product Managers (PMs) out there.<br/>
The thought of having nothing to show for the Stakeholders send shivers down their spines, keeping them up at night, while they frantically
scroll through the backlog, hoping to find **SOMETHING** they can push to the sprint planning.

> Punk ass Stakeholders trying to run the show<br/>
> Telling me what to do and where to go<br/>
> Check your email 'cause it's time to tell the team<br/>
>
> The Tickets are coming<br/>
> The Tickets are coming<br/>
> The Tickets are coming<br/>

####**At best it's a Zero Sum Game**

Like a professional Chef's knife, the minds of your team members must be kept sharp.<br/>
While work itself is the whetstone, mindless / meaningless tasks is akin to disrespecting the grain of the blade's metal.
You can observe that a lot in Design with the dreaded "Let's do it like Google!" tickets.<br/>
The unfounded changes that fail to take into account the **"Whys"** of their existence.<br/>
Sure, you now might have a Google-like dropdown, but you don't understand the meaning behind it or the use case that prompted its creation.<br/>
You just have... **Something**.

####**Decompression is important**

Teams are made up by Humans <sub><sup>(I think)</sub></sup>, by design we are made to adapt to our environment, it being the scalding sun of the Savanna
or high workloads at the office.<br/>
So it's easy to put your "Game Face" on and disregard your personal life, health and hobbies as long as you get the job done.<br/>
But every deep dive needs a **Decompression** Period, a time to reset their minds and bodies, to let them explore new things, maybe even write
that really bad blogpost or speedrun Sekiro on ultra hard.<br/>
Like engines or machines, working on full blast isn't sustainable in the long run. It causes burnout, it fucks with their mental and physical health,
strains personal relationships and stifles progress.<br/>

####**Playing Devil's Advocate**

I can already hear the PMs typing their long winded, defensive responses. But don't worry, we know you are only human.<br/>
This might sound like a contradiction but... Work is work at the end of the day.<br/>
Stakeholders will knock on your door, rubbing their stocks in your face while demanding to see results. And like us, you want to keep your job.<br/>
This isn't about making every task in your sprint something dope and interesting. Far from that.<br/>
It's about rethinking how you treat and stimulate your team.<br/>
Incentivize them to learn something new, to share knowledge with their coworkers, whatever it is as long as they get to break away from
the cycle of BS (building and shipping).<br/><br/>
Sometimes it's okay to not be busy.
