The can of Monster Ultra has long been relieved of its contents and my headphones have been blasting KPop and Gachi music for the last hour.<br/>
I can’t remember how many times today I’ve adjusted the DPI on my mouse or edited the on-board memory macros for it.

###**I’m bored**

And it’s not the “productive” type of bored where you drew the Jira short stick and got stuck with an annoying ticket.<br/>
It’s the type of boredom that only appears at the end of a Friday, where any other person would be planning a pub crawl with the lads.<br/>
But here I am, praying for that god-awful Slack bell to go off, notifying me that Q.A found a bug in my code.<br/>
But my prayers fall to deaf ears... Fuck me for writing bug-free code :Kappa:.

Let me be totally transparent here, **THIS IS NOT A TECHNICAL BLOG**!<br/>
Yes, I’ll mainly write about Tech, Javascript, GO, etc. But please be warned that, though I might seem like it, I’m not an one dimensional person.<br/>
I like video games, snus, beer, memes, linguistics, music…<br/>
Yeah, you’ve been warned.

Anyway, welcome to the Gondola Gang, grab a prilla of your favourite snus and enjoy your stay!
