Well... Hello again! You guys were probably wondering where I've been and the truth is I've been busy.<br/>
Since Mental Health is a pretty hot topic right now, guess there's no better time than now to open myself and vent for a bit.<br/>

####**Contextualizing my life**

A regular day in my life goes something like this: <br/>
- Wake up at 06:00
- Have a smoke before brushing my teeth + shower
- Smoke 2 darts before catching the bus
- Walk to the convinience store (that's 2 more ciggaretts)
- Buy my daily supply of Monster and Cup Noodles
- Walk to the office while smoking another cig and drinking a can of Red Bull
- Clock in at 07:30
- Crack open my morning Monster (Peach Rehab) and get my Snus on
- At 13:00 I'll have my lunch, which consists in a can of Monster Ultra
- Work
- Leave work at around 21:30
- Smoke 5 more ciggaretts before finally arriving at my appartment around 22:40
- Shower
- Eat my chicken Cup Noodles while writing my To-Dos for the next day
- Work on some side-project till 02:00 before going to bed and doing it all over again<br/>

####**Why do I put myself through that?**

Honestly? I like it... Neigh, I LOVE IT!<br/>
I love being in the office, I love coding, I love the feeling of being an important member of a team...<br/>
I love being... **Useful**.<br/>
Weekends, Holidays and Vacations (what the fuck are those) are the bane of my life. The mere idea of not working makes my skin crawl.<br/>
When, rightfully so, my coworkers or my PM complain that I'm pushing fixes or online on Slack at 3am on a Sunday, I interpret it as a good thing and not some sicklly obsession.<br/>
I don't care about promotions, praise or money. I want to work.<br/>

####**What's the price of doing what I do?**

![Everything](./everything.jpg)<br/>

It goes without saying that I don't have a good social life (or one at all).<br/>
My "friends" are my coworkers, but they only exist on Slack or during work hours.<br/>
Family? Well, they haven't been around for a while so it doesn't really matter here.<br/>
Relationships? HAHAHAHA...<br/>
Physical Health? Could be better but other than insomnia, IBS and being underweight, I'm pretty okay.<br/>
Mental Health? It's garbage. But you won't catch me admiting that. Most of it is a carry-over from years back, and I like to think that's the case.<br/>
