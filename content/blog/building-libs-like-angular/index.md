####**Why create your own Library? (DRAFT)**

- Creating generic/reusable solutions for shared or particular projects by extending Angular's base functionality
- Building a reusable component library for sharing between applications.
- Building shared service layer functionality - eg. a client for working with an external data source such as an API.

####**Keep in mind that:**

Due to the reusable nature of libraries, it's easy to get caught on the "Abstraction Hell". Sure, making so your code fulfills
every possible use case is, in theory, a good mindset, finding a middle ground between increasing the complexity of your codebase
and which problems you and your team are trying to tackle is the most sensible one, at least when starting out.
